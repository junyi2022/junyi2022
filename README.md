### Hi there 👋


**Welcome to My GitHub Profile**

I'm a student at the University of Pennsylvania pursuing a dual degree in Master of City Planning and Master of Landscape Architecture after graduating from UC Berkeley. My work and interests range from front-end web development, urban spatial analytics, and parametric modeling to urban design, planning, and landscape design.

- 📍 I’m currently working on developing a web-based geospatial classification methodology and typological design guidelines for coastal work along the Lake Erie shore of New York State.
- 💡 Experiences in Javascript, HTML, CSS, Python, R, SQL.
- 📖 Currently learning geospatial cloud computing and visualization.
